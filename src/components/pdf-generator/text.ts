export  const text= `Smart Brevity is a communication formula Kraal has been testing and perfecting for years.

It was invented in a newsroom — to elevate essential news, explain its impact, and deliver both in a concise and visual format
Now hundreds of organizations trust it — to boost engagement with staff, stakeholder, and member updates through a tool called Kraal.
The big picture: It works because it’s built on brain science. Smart Brevity leans into the modern ways people interact with information, then sets a structure to help make vital updates clearer and more memorable.

Why it matters
We’re living in a world with way too many words — emailed, texted, tweeted words — making it harder to find and focus on what matters.

We check our phones over 200 times a day
We decide within 17 milliseconds if we like what we just clicked
We spend less than 30 seconds, on average, reading whatever we do.
People have totally changed how they engage with communication — even when it’s essential to their jobs. Smart Brevity cuts through, tightening details to what’s new and necessary, organizing them in a way that’s efficient for an audience, and styling it in a way that’s easy to absorb.

The bottom line: Most Smart Brevity communications are about 50% shorter than traditional styles — with all the same important substance.

How it works
1. Audience first — always. Before you sit down to write, stand up to speak, or plug in to record, consider three things.

What is the goal of your communication; | Who is your ideal reader or listener; | Who is a real person who fits that profile?
Let that person guide the decisions you make. Keep only what’s new, interesting, or urgent to them. Cut anything that’s familiar.

Learn to raise the bar on what readers need.
2. Grab their attention. An effective headline or subject line will make the difference between five clicks and 50,000. Focus on three things.

Stay under 60 characters — people can read, remember, and repeat it
Keep it concrete — people should learn something from it
Stay conversational — people will move through it more quickly.
This is your first chance to engage your audience and also your first chance to lose them.

Learn how to craft an effective title or headline.
3. Say “What’s new” and “Why it matters.” Pick the most important detail you want readers to remember. Sum it up in one sentence, then say it first — always. It works because busy readers ask themselves two things when they see new information

What is this?
Is it relevant to me?
The more clearly — and quickly — you answer those questions, the better chance you have at keeping your audience engaged.

Learn to keep an audience hooked.
4. Write like a human. Imagine having coffee with the person you’re trying to reach. The same words you'd say to them are the ones you should write down.

Studies show short, simple language equates to confidence.
It’s also easier to consume and more memorable long-term.
You can communicate with the full spectrum of human emotion, sophistication, and nuance in Smart Brevity, while saying it in a simple way.

Learn the power of conversational writing.
5. Stay scannable. Some 60% to 80% of people will scan, not read, long passages of text, University of Maryland research found. But smart styling can break readers out of that fog.

Short paragraphs, bolding, and bullets get readers farther, faster.
Simple subject-verb-object sentences and punchy words help, too.
The goal is to be frugal with words — so your end result is shorter and looks approachable even at a quick scan.

Learn a smart way to cut read time.
6. Stop when enough is enough. Use as few words, sentences, and paragraphs as possible. The greatest gift that you can give to yourself — and others — is time. Learn to radically rethink how you communicate.

The bottom line: Smart Brevity is the art of being short, not shallow. If you apply these tips — and reflect on the urgent need for clarity and efficiency — your ideas will break through the noise and be heard.
