The dataset contains information about customer preferences and their satisfaction levels.\n\n## Methodology\nTo analyze the data, we used Python's Pandas library and performed various statistical techniques such as descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis.\n\n## Results\n\n### Descriptive Analysis\n- The survey was completed by 500 participants.\n- The average age of the participants was 35 years.\n- 60% of the participants were female, while 40% were male.\n- The majority of the participants had a college degree (70%).\n\n### Satisfaction Levels\n- The average satisfaction score given by participants was 7 out of 10.\n- The highest satisfaction score given was 9, while the lowest was 3.\n\n### Correlation Analysis\n- We found a strong positive correlation between customer satisfaction and the amount spent on products.\n- Age and satisfaction levels had a weak negative correlation.\n\n### Regression Analysis\n- We conducted a linear regression analysis to predict customer satisfaction based on various factors such as age, gender, and education level.\n- The model showed that age and education level are significant predictors of customer satisfaction.\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on our analysis, we have identified several insights regarding customer preferences and satisfaction levels. This information can be used to improve our products and services to enhance customer satisfaction.\n```\n\nPlease note that this is just a sample format, and you can modify it based on your specific analysis and requirements."

export const markdown_data: string = "To format TypeScript code using Markdown, you can use triple backticks (\\```) followed by the language name (typescript) to create a code block. Here's an example:\n\n```typescript\nfunction greet(name: string): string {\n  return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet(\"ChatGPT\"));\n```\n\nThis will format the code and display it as follows:\n\n```typescript\nfunction greet(name: string): string {\n  return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet(\"ChatGPT\"));\n```\n\nYou can also add syntax highlighting to make your code stand out. Simply replace the language name (`typescript`) in the opening backticks with a specific language code, such as:\n\n````\n```typescript\nfunction greet(name: string): string {\n  return \"Hello, \" + name + \"!\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(greet(\"ChatGPT\"));\n```\n````\n\nThis will produce the same result with highlighted syntax."
